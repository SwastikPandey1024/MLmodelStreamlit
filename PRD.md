# 📊 PRODUCT REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT (PRD)

## SalesPulse AI – Intelligent Sales Analytics Dashboard

---

## 🎯 Product Objective

To build an AI-powered web application that predicts future sales using historical trends and provides actionable business insights through an interactive dashboard.

---

## 👥 Target Users

* **Small & Medium Business Owners** – Need accurate sales forecasts for planning
* **Sales Managers** – Require trend analysis and performance metrics
* **Data Analysts** – Want interpretable ML predictions with explainability
* **E-commerce Operators** – Need real-time inventory and revenue planning

---

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1️⃣ Sales Prediction (Single Day)

* Predict next-day sales using XGBoost machine learning model
* Based on engineered lag features and rolling average metrics
* User provides:
  - Date of interest
  - Historical sales metrics (lag values, rolling averages)
  - Trend counter
* Output: Predicted sales value with confidence metrics

**Why It Matters:** Enables one-off "what-if" scenario testing without manual calculations

---

### 2️⃣ Trend Analysis (7-Day Forecast)

* Generate iterative 7-day sales forecast
* Visualize trends with line charts and comparative analysis
* Compare predicted values against historical averages
* Detect growth, decline, or stability patterns

**Why It Matters:** Helps businesses plan inventory and staffing in advance

---

### 3️⃣ Business Insights Engine

Automatically generate contextual business recommendations:

* **📈 Growth Detection** → "Strong growth expected - Scale inventory and staffing"
* **📉 Decline Detection** → "Sales decline expected - Run promotional activities"
* **➡️ Stability** → "Sales stable - Maintain current strategy"
* **⬆️ Above Average** → "+$X above 7-day average"
* **⬇️ Below Average** → "-$X below 7-day average"
* **⚡ Volatility Alerts** → "High volatility detected - Review marketing strategy"

**Why It Matters:** Non-technical users get actionable recommendations without data science knowledge

---

### 4️⃣ KPI Dashboard

Display critical metrics at a glance:

* Yesterday's Sales
* 7-day rolling average
* 14-day rolling average  
* 30-day rolling average
* Predicted sales value
* Percentage change indicators
* Trend indicators (↑ ↓ →)

**Why It Matters:** Executives can assess business health in seconds

---

### 5️⃣ Feature Importance Visualization

* Extract and visualize top influencing factors from ML model
* Show which features drive sales predictions
* Ranked importance chart
* Downloadable feature rankings

**Why It Matters:** Builds trust in model predictions and enables data-driven strategy

---

### 6️⃣ Bulk Prediction (Batch CSV Upload)

* Upload CSV file with multiple records
* Automatic feature validation
* Parallel prediction processing
* Download results as CSV
* Error handling per record (some failures won't block entire batch)

**Why It Matters:** Enables forecasting for entire product lines or multiple locations at once

---

### 7️⃣ Time-Based Feature Engineering

Automatic extraction of temporal features:

* **Date Components**: day, month, weekday, is_weekend, weekofyear
* **Lag Features**: Previous day (lag-1), 7-day, 14-day, 30-day sales
* **Rolling Metrics**: 7-day mean, 14-day mean, 7-day std deviation
* **Trend Counter**: Continuous trend indicator

**Why It Matters:** Captures seasonal patterns, day-of-week effects, and sales momentum

---

### 8️⃣ Model Explainability

* Display model architecture details
* Show training performance metrics (MAE, R² score)
* Feature importance rankings
* Model validation results

**Why It Matters:** Maintains user confidence and regulatory compliance

---

### 9️⃣ Performance Optimization

* **Cached Model Loading** – Model loaded once at app startup (not per prediction)
* **Efficient Data Processing** – Vectorized operations with NumPy/Pandas
* **Lazy Loading** – Feature importance computed only when needed

**Why It Matters:** Sub-2-second prediction times even under load

---

### 🔟 Error Resilience & Boot Diagnostics

* Boot diagnostics verify all dependencies before UI renders
* Safe model loading with detailed error messages
* File existence checks (model.pkl verification)
* Graceful degradation: fallback UI if model fails
* All errors visible to user (no silent crashes)

**Why It Matters:** Production-ready reliability for business-critical forecasting
